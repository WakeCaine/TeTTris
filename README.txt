NOTE:
Simple game like Tetris with additional mode.

Known problems:
Not working in fullscreen- had some issues with invisible blocks.
Also exit game using space and arrow keys. 
Exit by 'X' wont close program and music will still play.
Starting game and exit in next step will cause music to play like in normal game, 
even if you are in menu(two tracks playing at the same time).
